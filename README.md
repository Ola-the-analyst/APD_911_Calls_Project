# APD_911_Calls_Project

 Over the years, incident-related issues have risen significantly, leading to an increase in 911 calls. This has necessitated a shift in strategy, ensuring officers are dispatched only to incidents that cannot be resolved over the phone. To support this approach, this report analyzes over Nine Hundred and Fifty-Two Thousand, Eight Hundred and Thirty-Three (952833) 911 calls to enhance emergency response efficiency, assess the mental health impact of critical incidents, and evaluate the effectiveness of resource allocation.
